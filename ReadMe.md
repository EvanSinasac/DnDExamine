Built and Compiled in Visual Studios Debug and Release Win32 and x64.

This is a rapidJSON reader built around an Examine ability I homebrewed for a DnD campaign.

The program asks the user for the level of the Examine ability to determine how much information is needed to give them.
The reader always reads the entire JSON file.  Each file is for a different creature.
To add a new creature, follow template.json and fill in the information you require.

To close the program, type EXIT instead of a creature name.
